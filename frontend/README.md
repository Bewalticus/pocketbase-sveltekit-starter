# create-svelte

## Developing

```bash
npx pnpm install
npm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app (static HTML/JS app):

```bash
npm run build
```

Now you can serve production compiled version of the frontend using the backend
or any static file web server. You can preview the production build with
`npm preview`.
