# Backend with PocketBase

You must download the latest `pocketbase` release from
https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/releases/latest
and put it in this folder. Or if you want to customize pocketbase
then continue reading.

Then to run the backend, run the `backend` script in the `frontend`
directory with `npm run backend`. Now the frontend will be able
to hit the backend.
